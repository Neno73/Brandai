# Feature Specification: BrendAI - Automated Brand Merchandise Design System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-brendai-an`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build BrendAI: An automated brand merchandise design system that transforms company websites into custom branded merchandise designs"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Lead Capture Through Brand Kit Generation (Priority: P1)

A marketing manager at a mid-sized company visits the BrendAI landing page, enters their company website URL and email address, and receives a complete branded merchandise visualization kit via email within 8 minutes. The kit includes their logo, brand colors, a creative concept, design motifs, and 5 merchandise mockups (t-shirt, hoodie, mug, USB stick, socks) in a professional PDF presentation.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition and lead generation mechanism. Without this end-to-end flow, the system provides no value. It solves the "inspiration lock" problem by automatically generating tangible merchandise ideas.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a website URL and email, then verifying that a complete PDF presentation is delivered via email containing all required sections (brand analysis, creative concept, motifs, 5 product mockups) within 8 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user on the landing page, **When** they enter a valid website URL and email address and click "Create My Brand Kit", **Then** the system initiates brand scraping and displays a progress indicator showing "Analyzing website..."
2. **Given** brand scraping has completed successfully, **When** the system extracts logo, colors, and text content, **Then** it generates a creative concept describing the brand essence and merchandise direction
3. **Given** a creative concept has been generated, **When** the system creates design motifs using the brand colors and logo style, **Then** it produces 6 cohesive design elements suitable for merchandise applications
4. **Given** design motifs are ready, **When** the system applies them to the 5 pre-configured products, **Then** it generates realistic mockups showing how the brand elements appear on each product
5. **Given** all mockups are complete, **When** the system generates and sends the PDF presentation, **Then** the user receives an email within 8 minutes containing the PDF attachment and a magic link to view/edit the results online

---

### User Story 2 - Review and Regenerate Creative Concepts (Priority: P2)

A user reviews the automatically generated creative concept and brand analysis but feels it doesn't capture their sustainability focus. They click "Regenerate Concept" and receive a new variation that better emphasizes their environmental mission, all while preserving their extracted logo and brand colors.

**Why this priority**: Enables users to refine AI-generated content without starting over. Increases lead quality by ensuring users are satisfied with the creative direction before proceeding to product mockups.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing Stage 2 (concept generation), clicking the "Regenerate Concept" button, and verifying that a new concept is generated using the same scraped data but with creative variation, while preserving user edits to colors/logo.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing the generated creative concept, **When** they click "Regenerate Concept", **Then** the system calls the AI again with the same scraped data and displays a new creative concept within 20 seconds
2. **Given** a user has manually edited brand colors, **When** they regenerate the concept, **Then** the system preserves their color edits and uses them in the new concept
3. **Given** a user has uploaded a custom logo to replace the scraped one, **When** they regenerate the concept, **Then** the system uses the custom logo in the regenerated concept
4. **Given** a user lets the 3-minute timer expire without taking action, **When** the timeout occurs, **Then** the system auto-proceeds to motif generation using the current concept

---

### User Story 3 - Manual Brand Element Correction (Priority: P2)

The scraping process fails to detect a company's logo or only finds 1 brand color. The system blocks automatic progression and prompts the user to manually upload a logo and select at least 2 brand colors via a color picker before continuing to concept generation.

**Why this priority**: Critical error handling that prevents garbage-in, garbage-out scenarios. Without brand elements, the entire design process fails. This ensures minimum viable data quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by entering a website URL with no detectable logo or insufficient brand colors, then verifying the system blocks progression and requires manual input before allowing the user to proceed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the scraping process completes but no logo is found, **When** the system displays the brand analysis, **Then** it shows an error message and a file upload button, blocking progression to Stage 2 until a logo is uploaded
2. **Given** the scraping process finds only 1 brand color, **When** the system displays the brand analysis, **Then** it shows a warning and color picker interface, requiring the user to select at least 2 colors before proceeding
3. **Given** both logo and color requirements are met through manual input, **When** the user confirms their selections, **Then** the system proceeds to creative concept generation using the manually provided elements
4. **Given** the scraping process completely fails, **When** the error is detected, **Then** the system displays a manual input form for logo, colors (minimum 2), and optional text guidance for concept direction

---

### User Story 4 - Regenerate Design Motifs (Priority: P3)

A user reviews the 6 generated design elements but finds them too geometric for their organic, nature-focused brand. They click "Regenerate Motif" and receive a new set of 6 elements that better match their brand personality while maintaining the same color palette.

**Why this priority**: Allows creative refinement of design elements. Lower priority because the first generation is usually acceptable, but providing this option increases user satisfaction and lead quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing Stage 3 (motif generation), clicking "Regenerate Motif", and verifying that 6 new design elements are generated with the same brand colors but different creative interpretations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing the generated motif with 6 design elements, **When** they click "Regenerate Motif", **Then** the system generates a completely new set of 6 elements using the same logo style, colors, and creative concept within 60 seconds
2. **Given** a user regenerates the motif, **When** the new motif is displayed, **Then** all 6 elements maintain family consistency (similar style, weight, complexity) while varying creatively
3. **Given** a user regenerates the motif, **When** the system proceeds to product mockups, **Then** it uses the newly regenerated motif for all 5 products
4. **Given** a user lets the 3-minute timer expire without regenerating, **When** the timeout occurs, **Then** the system auto-proceeds to product mockup generation using the current motif

---

### User Story 5 - Resume Session via Magic Link (Priority: P3)

A user receives their brand kit PDF via email but wants to make adjustments. They click the magic link in the email and are taken directly to their session, where they can view all generated content, edit colors, regenerate concepts/motifs, and download updated assets without re-entering their website URL or email.

**Why this priority**: Enables re-engagement and lead nurturing. Users can return to refine their designs, increasing conversion opportunities. Lower priority because the core value (PDF delivery) is already achieved in P1.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing a full session, receiving the email, clicking the magic link, and verifying that the user can access all previously generated content and make edits without re-authentication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has received their brand kit email, **When** they click the magic link, **Then** they are taken to a session page showing all their generated content (scraped data, concept, motifs, product mockups)
2. **Given** a user is on their session page, **When** they edit brand colors and regenerate the concept, **Then** the system uses the new colors to generate an updated concept
3. **Given** a user regenerates any content on their session page, **When** they request a new PDF download, **Then** the system generates a fresh PDF with all current content and makes it available for download
4. **Given** a user's magic link is accessed from any device/browser, **When** they use the link, **Then** they can access their session without any additional authentication

---

### User Story 6 - Admin Product Configuration (Priority: P3)

A BrendAI administrator logs into the admin panel, uploads a new product mockup image (tote bag), defines its print zones (front, back), sets constraints (8-color maximum, no small details under 1cm), and saves it as the 6th product template. All future brand kit generations now include the tote bag mockup.

**Why this priority**: Enables system flexibility and scalability without code changes. Lower priority because the system launches with 5 pre-configured products, which is sufficient for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging into the admin panel, adding a new product with specific constraints, then running a brand kit generation and verifying the new product appears in the mockups.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin on the login page, **When** they enter the pre-configured credentials, **Then** they access the admin dashboard showing all sessions and product management interface
2. **Given** an admin in the product management section, **When** they upload a product mockup image, define print zones, enter constraint text, and set color limits, **Then** the product is saved as a template
3. **Given** a new product template has been saved, **When** any user generates a brand kit, **Then** the system includes the new product in the mockup generation process
4. **Given** an admin views the sessions table, **When** they click on a session, **Then** they see all scraped data, generated assets, and session status for that user

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when the website URL is invalid or unreachable?** The system displays an error message: "We couldn't access that website. Please check the URL and try again" and allows the user to re-enter the URL without losing their email address.

- **What happens when brand scraping takes longer than 60 seconds?** The system continues showing the "Analyzing website..." loader and extends the timeout to 90 seconds. If still incomplete, it shows an error and offers manual input as a fallback.

- **What happens when AI generation fails (concept, motif, or products)?** The system automatically retries once. If the retry fails, it displays an error message: "We're having trouble generating your designs. Please try again in a few moments" with a manual retry button.

- **What happens when email delivery fails?** The system logs the error, displays a success message to the user with the magic link (so they can still access their results), and attempts email delivery again after 5 minutes. The user is informed: "Your brand kit is ready! We're sending the email now, but you can view it immediately here: [magic link]"

- **What happens when a user submits the same website URL and email twice?** The system checks for existing sessions and offers two options: "Resume your previous session" or "Start a new brand kit". If they choose to start new, a fresh session is created.

- **What happens when the extracted logo is extremely low resolution or corrupted?** The system detects image quality issues and prompts the user to upload a higher resolution logo: "The logo we found may not print well. Please upload a high-quality version (PNG or JPG, minimum 500x500px)"

- **What happens when color extraction returns more than 5 colors?** The system selects the 5 most dominant colors by frequency in the logo and website design, prioritizing colors that appear in the logo itself.

- **What happens when the 3-minute countdown expires and the user made edits but didn't manually proceed?** The system saves all edits (color changes, logo uploads) and auto-proceeds to the next stage using the edited data.

- **What happens when generating product mockups and one product fails but others succeed?** The system includes the successful products in the PDF and shows a note: "We couldn't generate a mockup for [product name]. Please contact support if you'd like to regenerate it."

- **What happens when a session is abandoned during concept or motif generation?** After 24 hours, the system sends a recovery email: "Your brand kit is 60% complete - finish designing →" with the magic link to resume where they left off.

- **What happens when an admin tries to delete a product that's currently being used in active sessions?** The system prevents deletion and shows: "This product is used in [N] active sessions. Archive it instead?" Products can be archived (hidden from new generations) but not deleted.

- **What happens when the PDF generation exceeds 20 seconds?** The system continues attempting generation up to 60 seconds, then falls back to delivering the magic link via email with a message: "Your brand kit is ready online. We're preparing your PDF download - check your email in a few minutes."

### Key Entities

- **Session**: Represents a complete brand kit generation workflow for a specific user. Contains: unique identifier, user email, target website URL, current workflow status, all scraped brand data (logo, colors, fonts, themes, sentiment), generated creative concept text, motif image reference, product mockup image references, creation and update timestamps. Sessions persist indefinitely for lead nurturing.

- **Scraped Brand Data**: Embedded within Session. Contains: logo image file, array of hex color codes (up to 5), font family names, tagline, tone analysis, dominant business themes, target audience description, industry classification, sentiment analysis. This is the raw material for all creative generation.

- **Creative Concept**: Embedded within Session. Contains: 2-3 paragraphs of text describing brand essence and merchandise direction, identified primary theme focus. This serves as the narrative foundation for visual design decisions.

- **Design Motif**: Embedded within Session. Contains: single image URL containing 6 cohesive design elements, storytelling explanation text describing element choices and brand reflection. These elements are reused across all product mockups.

- **Product Template**: Admin-configurable template. Contains: product name, base mockup image reference, array of print zones (front, back, sleeves, etc.), constraint text describing printing/embroidery limitations, maximum color count, recommended element types. Determines how motifs are applied to products.

- **Product Mockup**: Generated for each product in a session. Contains: image URL showing motif applied to product, product template reference, generation timestamp. Five mockups are created per session.

- **Magic Link**: Unique session access URL. Contains: unique session identifier, no authentication required. Enables session resumption and content regeneration.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

- **SC-014**: Admin can configure and save a new product template in under 5 minutes
- **SC-015**: 90% of AI-generated product mockups respect the defined product constraints (print zones, color limits, size restrictions) without manual validation

### Qualitative Outcomes

- Users report that generated mockups accurately reflect their brand personality and provide concrete inspiration for merchandise decisions
- Marketing managers can use the PDF presentation directly in internal stakeholder discussions without requiring additional design work
- BrendAI sales team receives qualified leads with demonstrated interest (evidenced by session completion and magic link engagement)
- Admin team can expand product offerings without requiring developer intervention or code changes

## Assumptions

- **Website Accessibility**: Assumes most company websites are publicly accessible and do not require authentication or have strict anti-scraping measures. If scraping is blocked, manual input fallback is provided.

- **Brand Data Availability**: Assumes that third-party brand data services can reliably extract logos and colors for most established companies. Smaller companies or those without strong online brand presence may require more manual input.

- **AI Generation Reliability**: Assumes that AI generation models (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for text, Nanobana for images) produce usable results at least 85% of the time without extensive prompt engineering per request. Quality variance is managed through regeneration options.

- **Email Deliverability**: Assumes standard transactional email services achieve high deliverability rates. Magic links provide fallback access if email delivery fails.

- **Session Timeout Behavior**: Assumes 3 minutes is sufficient for most users to review generated content. Power users can disable auto-progression through future enhancements.

- **Product Constraint Compliance**: Assumes AI models reliably follow visual design constraints (color limits, print zones) when provided in prompts. Manual validation is not included in MVP but could be added if constraint violations are frequent.

- **Single-Page Brand Scraping**: Assumes homepage content is sufficient to understand brand personality for MVP. Multi-page scraping is deferred to future enhancements.

- **Standard Authentication**: Admin panel uses simple email/password authentication hardcoded for MVP. This assumes single-tenant use case and will be replaced with proper user management in production.

- **No Payment Processing**: Assumes the MVP focuses purely on lead generation and visualization. Actual merchandise ordering and payment are handled outside the system through sales team follow-up.

- **Reasonable Use Quotas**: Assumes AI API usage stays within reasonable free/trial tier limits during MVP testing. Production will require proper quota management and rate limiting.

- **PDF as Sufficient Deliverable**: Assumes users find PDF presentations valuable without requiring interactive web presentations or vector file exports in MVP. These are planned for future enhancements.

- **Persistence Without Cleanup**: Assumes session data can persist indefinitely without archival/cleanup logic in MVP. Storage management will be added for production scale.

## Open Questions
