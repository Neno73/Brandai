## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (T001-T009) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion (T010-T024) - Core MVP
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can run in parallel with US1 if staffed
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can run in parallel with US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 Stage 3 completion (T038) - Requires motif generation
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 completion (T048) - Requires full workflow
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can run in parallel with US1-US3
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (T010-T024) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 Stage 2 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Extends US1 error handling but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US1 Stage 3 (motif generation) - Extends regeneration capability
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Depends on US1 completion - Requires full workflow and magic links
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent admin functionality

### Critical Path for MVP (User Story 1 Only)

1. Setup (T001-T009) ‚Üí ~2 hours
2. Foundational (T010-T024) ‚Üí ~8 hours
3. US1 Stage 1: Scraping (T025-T032) ‚Üí ~6 hours
4. US1 Stage 2: Concept (T033-T036) ‚Üí ~4 hours
5. US1 Stage 3: Motif (T037-T039) ‚Üí ~4 hours
6. US1 Stage 4: Products (T040-T042) ‚Üí ~6 hours
7. US1 Stage 5: PDF & Email (T043-T047) ‚Üí ~6 hours
8. US1 Integration (T048-T050) ‚Üí ~4 hours

**Total MVP Estimate**: ~40 hours for single developer

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks T001-T009 can run in parallel (different config files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Can parallelize:
- Database tasks (T010, T013-T015)
- TypeScript types (T011-T012, T016-T020)
- Utility functions (T017-T019, T021-T024)

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**: Within each stage, can parallelize:
- Stage 1: T025+T026 (API clients), T029+T030 (UI components)
- Stage 2: T035+T036 (UI components can be built while service is in progress)
- Stage 4: T042 (gallery component) can be built while T040-T041 in progress

**Phase 4-8 (User Stories 2-6)**: All can run in parallel by different developers after Foundational completion, except:
- US4 requires US1 Stage 3 completion
- US5 requires US1 full completion

**Week 3: Advanced Features (US4, US5, Polish)**
- Days 1-2: User Story 4 (Motif regeneration) ‚Üí Deploy
- Days 3-4: User Story 5 (Magic links) ‚Üí Deploy
- Days 5-7: Phase 9 (Polish, testing, optimization)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational completion:

**Developer A**: User Story 1 (Core workflow)
**Developer B**: User Story 6 (Admin panel) ‚Üí US2 (Regeneration)
**Developer C**: User Story 3 (Error handling) ‚Üí US4 (Motif regen)

After US1 completes:
**All Developers**: User Story 5 (Magic links) ‚Üí Polish

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Optional - not in tasks)

If testing is required, add tests for:
- `lib/services/gemini-text.ts` - Concept generation
- `lib/services/gemini-image.ts` - Motif and product generation
- `lib/utils/magic-link.ts` - Token generation and validation
- `lib/utils/validation.ts` - Zod schema validation

### Integration Tests (Included in T098)

Critical API routes to test:
- POST `/api/scrape` - Full scraping orchestration
- POST `/api/generate-concept` - Concept generation with retries
- POST `/api/send-email` - Email delivery with Resend

### E2E Tests (Included in T099)

Complete user journey:
1. Land on homepage
2. Submit URL and email
3. Wait for scraping
4. View brand analysis
5. Proceed through concept
6. Proceed through motif
7. Wait for product generation
8. Receive completion message
9. Verify email sent

## Notes

- [P] tasks can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1-US6) for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- MVP scope is User Story 1 only (T001-T050) = ~40 hours single developer
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- All file paths are absolute from repository root
- External API keys must be configured before testing (see quickstart.md)
- Neon Postgres database must be created and migrated before running app
- Vercel Blob Storage must be configured for image uploads
- Tests (Phase 9: T098-T099) are included but optional based on project requirements

## Success Validation

After completing MVP (User Story 1), verify:

‚úÖ User can submit website URL and email on landing page
‚úÖ System successfully scrapes brand data (logo, colors, text) from 80%+ of websites
‚úÖ Creative concept generates within 20 seconds
‚úÖ Design motif displays 6 cohesive elements within 60 seconds
‚úÖ All 5 product mockups generate within 5 minutes
‚úÖ PDF presentation is created with all 7 sections
‚úÖ Email is delivered with PDF attachment and magic link
‚úÖ Total workflow completes in under 8 minutes
‚úÖ Magic link allows session access without authentication

After completing all user stories, additionally verify:

‚úÖ "Regenerate Concept" produces creative variations
‚úÖ "Regenerate Motif" produces new element sets
‚úÖ Manual logo upload and color selection works when scraping fails
‚úÖ Admin can add new product templates
‚úÖ Abandoned sessions receive recovery emails after 24 hours
‚úÖ System handles 50 concurrent sessions without degradation
