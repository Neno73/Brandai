# Specification Quality Checklist: BrendAI - Automated Brand Merchandise Design System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All validation items complete

### Content Quality Assessment
- The spec is written in business language focusing on user needs and outcomes
- No specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches are mentioned
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are comprehensive and complete
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all decisions made with documented assumptions
- 90 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- Each requirement uses clear "MUST" language with observable outcomes
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "Users can complete... in under 8 minutes" vs. "API response time is 200ms")
- 6 prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (Given-When-Then format)
- 13 edge cases identified covering error scenarios, boundary conditions, and recovery flows
- Scope is clearly bounded through MVP definition and "Future Enhancements" exclusions
- 12 documented assumptions cover key design decisions and constraints

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- All 90 functional requirements map to user scenarios and edge cases
- User stories are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
- 15 measurable success criteria plus 4 qualitative outcomes provide comprehensive validation framework
- Specification maintains strict separation between "what" (requirements) and "how" (implementation)
- Zero implementation leakage detected

## Notes

Specification is production-ready and suitable for:
- `/speckit.plan` - to create detailed implementation plan
- Stakeholder review and approval
- Developer handoff for technical design

No updates required before proceeding to planning phase.
